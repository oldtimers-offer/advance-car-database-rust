This project focuses on developing a high-performance, secure backend for a classic vehicles database using Rust. The backend is built with the Rocket framework, providing a fast and safe way to handle HTTP requests. Diesel is utilized for seamless integration with a PostgreSQL database, enabling efficient management of classic vehicle records.

The system supports full CRUD operations, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete entries related to vintage cars. Key features include detailed vehicle attributes such as make, model, year, condition, and restoration history. The backend is optimized for performance and designed with scalability in mind, ensuring smooth handling of large datasets. Robust input validation and security practices, such as SQL injection protection and data encryption, are employed to safeguard user and vehicle information.

This project is ideal for car enthusiasts, collectors, and restorers, providing them with an efficient tool to manage and explore a wide range of classic vehicles.
